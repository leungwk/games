References to "Fulke" refers to the 1563 translation by "Ralph Lever and
augmented by William Fulke". A printing in more modern English appears
in /The Philosopher's Game/ (2001) by Ann E. Moyer.

The game logic, its movement, taking, drop, and victory rules, were
taken and interpreted from Fulke.

The code allows one to mix and match different rules by changing the
=settings= value when initalizing =Rith=.
